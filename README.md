# About

Zombie Panic! (Half-Life Modification) source code is not 1-to-1 code of the original prototype from 2003, as it has been re-written from the ground up using [BugfixedHL](https://github.com/tmp64/BugfixedHL-Rebased) as it's base due to VGUI2 support and it's many other features. However, some features have been stripped away, and/or deprecated to fit ZP gameplay and feel.

# What isn't supported

Backwards compatibility with WON and older versions of Steam Half-Life is not supported. Xash isn't supported, but may work. You cannot use Updated clients to play on vanilla servers, you also cannot use vanilla clients to play on Updated servers.

Placing Updated game dlls in vanilla installations is not supported.

These repositories have a limited scope and will not have major changes applied.
